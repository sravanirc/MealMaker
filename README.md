# MealMaker
Meal Planner is a website that suggests a meal made up of a starter, a main and a dessert
## How it Works:
My meal-planning website utilizes an intelligent algorithm that randomly selects a starter, a main course, and a dessert from a curated collection of 10 delectable options in each category.
## How to use: 
Simply Click the "Generate Random Meal" button, and my algorithm will present you with a handpicked combination of a starter, main course, and dessert.
